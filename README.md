# HappinessBot
Due to the corona crisis, we are all working from home indefinitely. We used to read out thank you / encouragement notes after the company strategy meeting, but this does not work well over zoom. People tend to like writing anonymous notes, so it would be great if we could have some virtual way of sending anonymous thank yous.

## Goal
This project aims to build a slackbot that users can use to annonymously post thank yous and encouragement notes into the #happiness channel.

## Stretch goals
Additionally, we could:
* include gifs
* tag users
* code it in python instead!

## Background
This project will make use of the /slash api provided by slack. It might be straightforward to do through Python and Flask, but online resources suggest that this might be easier to do using Ruby and Sintara. We will make use of two tutorials that each do not do exactly what we want, but the information in both of them hopefully will be enough to help us get all the way.
